# Cryptocurrency Mining

## Prerequisites

> Assume you have already [set up a machine](Hardware.md)
>
> (i.e. assemble one with GPU and installed driver (e.g. cuda for Nvidia GPU with specific version with your miner))
>
> You will need additional setup for [mining Ethereum on GTX 1080/ti & Titan XP](Other/ETHlargementPill)

General Procedure

1. Get a wallet
2. Choose a mining pool (or you want solo mining) for your target currency (e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum)
3. Choose a miner
4. Setup miner with your wallet information & mining pool

There is potential that Windows thinks the miner is a virus. This is how to configure:

1. Search "Virus & threat protection"
2. Goto "Virus & threat protection settings" and click "Manage settings"
3. Goto "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions"
4. Add this folder (i.e. the repository directory)

Note

* Usually, a mining pool will have its payout policy and normally you will have to mine over a threshold to be paid.
* But since a transaction might need some tax or fee or whatever, so don't take out too often can reduce this cost.

## Start Mining

* [Mine Ethereum](Ethereum)

Hacking

* [Mining Ethereum on GTX 1080/ti & Titan XP](Other/ETHlargementPill)
* (TODO) [Bypass mining fee](Other/MiningFeeHack)

## Notes

* [Background Knowledge](Background.md)
* [Cryptocurrency](Cryptocurrency.md)
  * Bitcoin
  * Ethereum
* [Managing Digital Currency](Managing.md)
  * Wallet - To keep your mined currency
  * Digital Currency Exchange - To exchange your digital currency to money
* [Mining Pools](MiningPool.md)
* [Miner](Miner.md)
* [Cost](Cost.md)

## TODO

* [X] Undervolting and Overclocking => Enlarge GTX 1080 mining speed
  * [X] Windows
  * [X] Linux
* [ ] Dual Mining
* [ ] Find target to mine on laptop or machine with low GPU RAM
  * [ ] Try Ravencoin (RVN)
* [ ] Move Mining Pool notes to where it belongs (i.e. ETH)

Low priority

* [ ] Bypass Mining Fee of Miner
* [ ] Test if ETHlargementPill can be activated remotely
