General Procedure

1. Get a wallet
2. Choose a mining pool (or you want solo mining) for your target currency (e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum)
3. Choose a miner
4. Setup miner with your wallet information & mining pool

There is potential that Windows thinks the miner is a virus. This is how to configure:

1. Search "Virus & threat protection"
2. Goto "Virus & threat protection settings" and click "Manage settings"
3. Goto "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions"
4. Add this folder (i.e. the directory)

Note

* Usually, a mining pool will have its payout policy and normally you will have to mine over a threshold to be paid.
* But since a transaction might need some tax or fee or whatever, so don't take out too often can reduce this cost.
