Usually when mining ZIL you need to mine ETH on the same pool or you need to rely on a pool proxy forwarding mechanism implemented by the pool.

> Get the answers to the frequently asked questions regarding DAG sizes of Ethash coins
>
> **What is a DAG file?**
>
> Ethash and variants are a proof-of-work systems which use a lot of memory to operate. Years ago when it all started, Ethash algorithm required around 1 GB large dataset, which is also known as DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph. Because it takes a lot of time to generate such large dataset, Ethash algoritm makes sure to remember the value and saves it to the memory. However, the DAG file size didn't stay at 1 GB, but it increases with each epoch. And epoch increases every 30,000 blocks. With years of mining, each Ethash coin increased in their DAG file size, which at this moment makes some GPUs obsolete for mining some coins.
>
> **What is a DAG epoch?**
>
> Epoch is a period of mining. The epoch increases for every 30,000 blocks for all ETH and other Ethash coins and 60,000 blocks for ETC.
>
> **What is a DAG size?**
>
> DAG size is the size of the DAG file. Even though the DAG size of each Ethash coin is increasing with same frequency, not all coins have the same DAG size. This is because different coins are mining at different block heights.
>
> **Can you mine Ethereum with 4 GB GPUs?**
>
> Current Ethereum's DAG size is 4.1172 GB, which means you can't mine ETH with 4GB cards anymore. lolMiner and some other mining clients allow zombie mode mining with reduced hashrate. Read what to mine with 4GB GPUs.
>
> **Can you mine Ethereum Classic with 4 GB GPUs?**
>
> Currently Ethereum Classic's DAG size is 2.6016 GB, which means you can mine ETC on cards that have 3GB or more memory.
>
> **What is current Ethereum DAG size?**
>
> Current Ethereum's DAG size is 4.1172 GB.
