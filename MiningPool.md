To use the available #Ethereum block space more efficiently we've optimized our #Ethermine Pool payout policy.

The min daily payout threshold will be increased to 0.1 ETH & the min weekly payout threshold will be increased to 0.05 ETH.⛏

This means ~50% less payout tx in total!
```

> Ethermine has a 1% fee and shares the transaction fees from the block.
